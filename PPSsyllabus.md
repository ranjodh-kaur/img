##_PART - A_ 

### Unit 1:<br>
 Introduction to Programming, Introduction to components of a computer system (disks, memory, processor, where a program is stored and executed, operating system, compilers etc.) [1]<br>
Idea  of  Algorithm:  steps  to  solve  logical  and  numerical  problems.  [1] <br>
Representation  of Algorithm: Flowchart/Pseudocode with examples.  [1] <br>
From   algorithms   to   programs;   source   code,   variables   (with   data   types)   variables   and memorylocations, Syntax and Logical Errors in compilation, object and executable code. [1] <br>

### Unit 2:<br>
 Arithmetic expressions and precedence  Conditional Branching and Loops 
Writing and evaluation of conditionals and consequent branching Iteration and loops [8]
